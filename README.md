# Remap the ยง key to the ` on macOS

If you've bought a Mac in the UK recently you may have noticed a key sitting left of the number 1 key which you have never used in your life before. I'm talking of course about the ยง key. This script will remap this key to a more useful one - `. If you prefer to remap it to some other key, be sure to [read my article on the subject](https://dchakarov.com/blog/macbook-remap-keys/).

## Usage

### Execute at login

The most convenient way to use the script is to add the `restoreTildeKey.sh.command` to Login Items so it executes at login.


### Manual

You can run it manually by double-clicking `restoreTildeKey.sh.command` in Finder or running it from the terminal.

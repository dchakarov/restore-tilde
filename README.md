# Remap the § key to the ` on macOS

If you've bought a Mac in the UK recently you may have noticed a key sitting left of the number 1 key which you have never used in your life before. I'm talking of course about the § key. This script will remap this key to a more useful one - `. If you prefer to remap it to some other key, be sure to [read my article on the subject](https://dchakarov.com/blog/macbook-remap-keys/).

## Usage

### Execute at login

The most convenient way to use the script is to add the `RestoreTildeKey.app` to Login Items so it executes at login.

### Manual

Another way would be to execute the `restoreTildeKey.sh` script in Terminal

``` bash
$ chmod +x restoreTildeKey.sh
$ ./restoreTildeKey.sh
```
